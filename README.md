# Digital-Media-Tools
Tools to capture screenshots at specific timecodes retrieved from Excel sheet.

**It's extremely easy to use:**
- Fill-in the required timecodes in the conversion excel file.
- Copy the prober the column of your asset's framerate.
- Paste them in the .txt file.
- DND the asset onto the .bat file, Then the tool will prompt you to DND the .txt file.
- Voila!, You have your Screenshots.

The .bat is orinigal to me, I used the opensource FFMPEG to extract the multi screenshots.

# Enjoy!
